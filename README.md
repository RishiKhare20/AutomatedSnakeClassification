# AutomatedSnakeClassification
This system is helpful in reducing the  death by snake bites and to suggest  appropriate anti venom for the victim in  a short span of time. The previous works have built systems with relatively smaller databases using ML and other deep architectures.

The systems were capable of identifying only a few snake species and/or had lower accuracies. However, the Snake classification can further be improved in order to make the system more robust. The proposed system is capable of identifying about 770 classes of snake species and is built with a relatively larger dataset using newer deep learning architecture ResNeXt50-V2. An ensembled model is used to further improve the system to achieve an accuracy of 86% and F1-score of 0.65.

The primary source of data for this project was online biodiversity platforms, particularly iNaturalist and HerpMapper. Additional data was collected by scraping images from Flickr and gathering images from private collections and museums. The resulting dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tailed class distribution, with the most common species (Thamnophis Sirtalis) represented by a substantial 22,163 images, while the least common species (Achalinus Formosanus) had only 10 images. The final dataset was divided into two distinct sets: a training set containing 347,405 images and a validation set with 38,601 images. Both sets maintain the same class distribution, with each class having at least one image in the validation set.

In summary, snake species identification is a complex endeavor, mainly due to the vast diversity of snake species and the presence of a dataset with a skewed class distribution. We have developed an automatic classification system utilizing the ResNeXt50-V2 architecture, which has yielded an F1-score of 0.738.Looking ahead, there are avenues for further improvement in the system's accuracy. This includes enhancing image preprocessing techniques to refine the input data. Additionally, exploring and implementing alternative deep learning architectures may yield even better accuracy results, thereby advancing the performance of the model in snake species identification.
